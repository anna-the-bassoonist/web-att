While education encourages accuracy and precision, an open mind advocates for creativity and brilliance. As a musician, educator and web designer, I accomplish my tasks with such combinations. As a junior front-end developer, my passion for building websites are motivated through my philosophy to always do my best in all projects. Additionally, with my master degrees in both music performance and music education, I work not only artistically, but also thoroughly and proficiently. Whether I play the bassoon, teach, or create a webpage, it is my responsibility as a multifaceted artist and programmer to constantly strive for excellence."
